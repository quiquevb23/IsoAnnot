def check_negbin_adjustment(obs, mean, var, bins_number=16):
    r"""
    Considers a Negative Binomial distribution of given mean and var, and
    performs an adjustement test of this distrubution with regards to obs.

    Returns the result of a Cramer's V adjustment test.

    A classical Chi-squared test cannot be used, since in a typical use case
    sample size will be only 250 (shuffles) and as such expected frequency for
    each value will be well under 5. As such, we perform the Chi-Squared test
    on an equivalent "histogram" : instead of computing the expected number
    of variates exactly equal to, say, 22, we compute how many variates fall in
    the 20-30 range.
    Target bin number is ajustable, final bin number may vary due to rounding.

    Futhermore, the Chi-Squared test can artificially return (H0 false) if n is
    too large. Hence, we use Cramer's V test instead.

    The function returns 1 - V, where V is the Cramer's V test of a crosstab
    made by concatenating the observed counts and expected counts vectors.

    The V test is here used to determine whether there is an association between
    counts distribution and the status as 'expected' or 'observed'.
    As per Cramer (1948) a good fit should have a fit quality above 1 - 0.25 = 0.75
    because V > 0.25 would mean association in most cases.
    Typically, you will observe good association when len(obs) is in the thousands.
    When it is in the hundreds only, random chance may result in a okay-ish
    association (around 0.8). Conversely, if len(obs) is in the thousands, only
    fits above 0.9 should be considered good.

    :param obs: Observed values.
    :param mean: The mean for the negative binomial model.
    :param var: The variance for the negative binomial model.
    :param bins_number: The number of bins in histogram.

    :Example:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import scipy.stats
    >>> np.random.seed(42)
    >>> mean = 100 ; var = 200
    >>> r = mean**2 / (var-mean) ; p = 1/(mean/r + 1)
    >>> rv = scipy.stats.nbinom(r, p)
    >>> obs = rv.rvs(2000)
    >>> fit = np.around(check_negbin_adjustment(obs, mean, var),2)
    >>> assert fit > 0.95
