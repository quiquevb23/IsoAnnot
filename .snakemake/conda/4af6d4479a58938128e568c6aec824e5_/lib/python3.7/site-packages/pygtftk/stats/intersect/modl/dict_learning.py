"""
This module contains the MODL algorithm, an itemset mining algorithm that broadly consists of two steps.

Considering an input matrix with transactions/regions.intersections in lines and
elements/items/sets in columns, the algorithm will : (I) learn (MiniBatchDictionaryLearning)
several factorisations with different sparsity constraints to build a library of
candidate words (eg. (1,1,0,0,1)) and (II) select the best words to rebuild the 
original matrix using a greedy algorithm, by trying to rebuild the original 
matrix with a subset of selected words, adding the word that best improves the 
rebuilding to said subset each time.

Dictionary learning is an optimization problem solved by alternatively updating the 
sparse code, as a solution to multiple Lasso problems, considering the dictionary fixed,
and then updating the dictionary to best fit the sparse code.

In OLOGRAM, we use this on the matrix of true overlap flags to find usual common overlaps.

This is mostly useful if there are many files to reduce the number of displayed combinations,
and to counteract the effect of noise on the data. Unlike classical association
rules mining algorithms, this focuses on mining complexes and correlation groups (item sets).

class Modl:
    r"""
    This class encapsulates the MODL approach :

    Takes as input a matrix of flags, with one flag per intersection,
    and returns the list of interesting combis.

    For more details, please see the module description of pygtftk/stats/intersect/modl/dict_learning.py

    :param flags_matrix: Matrix of overlaps
    :param multiple_overlap_target_combi_size: Candidates longer than this will be discarded
    :param multiple_overlap_max_number_of_combinations: Final desired number of combinations
    :param nb_threads: Number of threads
    :param step_1_factor_allowance: In step 1 of building the candidates, how many words are allowed in the Dictionary Learning as a proportion of multiple_overlap_max_number_of_combinations
    :param error_function: error function used in step 2. Default to manhattan error. 
    :param smother: Should the smothering which reduces each row's abudane to its square root to emphasize rarer combinations be applied ? Default is True
    :param normalize_words: Normalize the words by their summed squares in step 2. Default True.
    :param step_2_alpha: Override the alpha used in step 2.

    Passing a custom error function, it must have the signature error_function(X_true, X_rebuilt, code). X_true is the real data, X_rebuilt is the reconstruction to evaluate, and code is the encoded version which in our case is used to assess sparsity
