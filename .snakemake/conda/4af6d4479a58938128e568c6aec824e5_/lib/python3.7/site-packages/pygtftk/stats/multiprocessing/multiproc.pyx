Using Cython and OpenMP to multiprocess any arbitrary function over NumPy arrays.
As of January 2020, the functions here are not yet used in a meaningful way in the code.

OLOGRAM implements some examples of use, but in parts of the code where it does not bring much meaningful improvement.
Consider these as examples of what multiprocessing can do, it you need it later.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES :

The main function of this module is apply_func_multiproc_cython() ; it applies a
user-defined nogil function over a list of NumPy arrays. The list will first be
converted to a list of C arrays.
The function to be applied must have a very specific signature (see comments of
apply_func_multiproc_cython() for details) ; in broad strokes, it must return a
result object containing a single 2D result array.

These functions are designed for 2D arrays because this is what I use here.

I use long long all over the place for compatibility reasons. The arrays will
be long longs and that will not change, but the shapes could have been int.
However there will be few shapes so that's okay.
